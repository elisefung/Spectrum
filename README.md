Spectrum
========================

Spectrum is a web app that uses color theory to recommend the best media content to match whatever the user is up to at the moment.

It was created by Elise Fung and Stephanie Lee, as a semester project for NEU's Human Computer Interactions course. We plan on revisiting this project soon to add dynamic content.
